1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

    The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of USA
Education, Inc. (the "Company"), formerly SLM Holding Corporation, have been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP")
for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the
information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete consolidated financial
statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal
recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been
included. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. Operating results for the three months ended
March 31, 2001 are not necessarily indicative of the results for the year ending
December 31, 2001.

2. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

    In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 ("SFAS 133"), "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities," which requires that every derivative
instrument, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability
measured at its fair value. SFAS 133, as amended by Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 137, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities--Deferral of Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133," and Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 138, "Accounting for Certain Derivative
Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities," was effective for the Company's
financial statements beginning January 1, 2001. SFAS 133, as amended, requires
that changes in the derivative instrument's fair value be recognized currently
in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. Special
accounting for derivative financial instruments that qualify as fair value
hedges allows a derivative instrument's gains and losses to offset related fair
value changes on the hedged item in the income statement. Derivative financial
instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges are reported as adjustments to
stockholders' equity as a component of other comprehensive income. Hedge
accounting for derivative instruments requires that a company formally document,
designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge
accounting treatment. SFAS 133 could result in increased period to period
volatility in reported net income. The Company implemented the new standard on
January 1, 2001 (see Note 6). In conjunction with the implementation of SFAS
133, the Company reclassed $2 million of held-to-maturity securities to trading
securities as permitted under the transition provisions of SFAS 133.

    In October 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140 ("SFAS 140"), "Accounting for
Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
Liabilities--a Replacement of FASB Statement No. 125." SFAS 140 requires new
disclosures about securitizations and retained interests in securitized
financial assets and revises the criteria involving qualifying special purpose
entities. Under SFAS 140, entities are required to disclose information about
securitizations regarding accounting policies, securitization characteristics,
key assumptions used and cash flows between the securitization special purpose
entities and the transferor. Additionally, entities are required to disclose
information related to retained interests in

securitized financial assets, information regarding accounting policies for
subsequent measuring of retained interests, key assumptions used in subsequent
fair value measurements, sensitivity analysis showing hypothetical effects on
fair values based on unfavorable variations from key assumptions and general

delinquencies and credit losses. These new disclosure requirements are to be

4. STUDENT LOAN SECURITIZATION

    When the Company sells student loans in securitizations, it retains
interest-only strips and servicing rights, all of which are retained interests
in the securitized receivables. Gain or loss on sale of the receivables depends
in part on the previous carrying amount of the financial assets involved in the
transfer, allocated between the assets sold and the retained interests based on
their relative fair values at the date of transfer. To obtain fair values,
quoted market prices are used if available. However, quotes are generally not
available for retained interests, so the Company estimates fair value, both
initially and on a quarterly basis going forward, based on the present value of
future expected cash flows estimated using management's best estimates of the
key assumptions - credit losses, prepayment speeds and discount rates.

    During the first quarter of 2001, the Company sold $1.5 billion of student
loans in one securitization transaction and securitized $288 million through the
recycling provisions of the USA Group securitizations. The Company recorded a
pre-tax securitization gain of $9 million or .53 percent of the portfolios
securitized in the first quarter of 2001. In the first quarter of 2000, the
Company sold $4.0 billion of student loans in two securitization transactions
and recorded a pre-tax securitization gain

of $42 million or 1.05 percent of the portfolios securitized. At March 31, 2001
and December 31, 2000, securitized student loans outstanding totaled
$30.5 billion and $29.9 billion, respectively.

    In those securitizations, the Company retained servicing responsibilities
and received annual servicing fees of 0.9 percent per annum of the outstanding
balance of student loans other than consolidation loans and 0.5 percent per
annum of the outstanding balance of consolidation loans. The Company also
receives rights to future cash flows arising after the investors in the trust
have received the return for which they have contracted. Trust investors and the
securitization trusts have no recourse to the Company's other assets. The
Company's retained interests are subordinate to investors' interests. Their
value is subject to credit, prepayment, and interest rate risks.

    Key economic assumptions used in measuring the fair value of retained
interests at the date of securitization resulting from the student loan
securitization transaction completed during the first quarter of 2001 were as
follows:

<TABLE>
<S>                                                          <C>
Prepayment speed...........................................  7% per annum
Weighted-average life......................................  4.4 years
Expected credit losses.....................................  0.5%
Residual cash flows discounted at..........................  12%
</TABLE>

    Expected credit losses resulting from loans securitized in 2001 are
dependent on the portfolio's expected rate of defaulted loans, the level of
insurance guarantee which ranges from 98 percent to 100 percent of the unpaid
principal and interest of the defaulted loan, and the expected level of
defaulted loans not eligible for insurance guarantee due to servicing
deficiencies (approximately one percent of defaulted loans). The expected dollar
amount of credit losses is divided by the portfolio's principal balance to
arrive at the expected credit loss percentage. Except for net proceeds, there
were no cash flows between the Company and the securitization trust that closed
during the first quarter of 2001.

5. COMMON STOCK

    Basic earnings per common share ("Basic EPS") are calculated using the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each
period. Diluted earnings per common share ("Diluted EPS") reflect the potential
dilutive effect of additional common shares that are issuable upon

6. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

    The Company maintains an overall interest rate risk management strategy that
incorporates the use of derivative instruments to minimize significant unplanned
fluctuations in earnings that are caused by interest rate volatility. The
Company's goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity by modifying the repricing
or maturity characteristics of certain balance sheet assets and liabilities so
that the net interest margin is not, on a material basis, adversely affected by
movements in interest rates. As a result of interest rate fluctuations, hedged
assets and liabilities will appreciate or depreciate in market value. Income or
loss on the derivative instruments that are linked to the hedged assets and
liabilities will generally offset the effect of this unrealized appreciation or
depreciation. The Company views this strategy as a prudent management of
interest rate sensitivity, such that earnings are not exposed to undue risk
presented by changes in interest rates.

    Derivative instruments that are used as part of the Company's interest rate
risk management strategy include interest rate swaps, futures contracts, and
interest rate floor and cap contracts with indices that relate to the pricing of
specific balance sheet assets and liabilities. As a matter of policy, the
Company does not use highly leveraged derivative instruments for interest rate
risk management. Interest rate swaps generally involve the exchange of fixed and
variable rate interest payments between two parties, based on a common notional
principal amount and maturity date. Interest rate futures generally involve
exchange-traded contracts to buy or sell Treasury or Agency securities in the
future at specified prices or exchange-traded Eurodollar/LIBOR contracts whose
value is derived from changes in LIBOR loan rates. Interest rate floor and cap
contracts generally involve the paying or receiving of interest above or below a
stated strike rate in exchange for an upfront premium payment.

6. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)
    The Company also enters into various interest rate contracts for trading and
macro risk management purposes. Trading activities (which include derivative
transactions entered into for risk management purposes and which do not
otherwise qualify for hedge accounting) primarily involve providing various
derivative products to counterparties and managing overall enterprise risk and
risks in other trading portfolios.

    By using derivative instruments, the Company is exposed to credit and market
risk. If the counterparty fails to perform, credit risk is equal to the extent
of the fair value gain in a derivative. When the fair value of a derivative
contract is positive, this generally indicates that the counterparty owes the
Company. When the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, the Company
owes the counterparty and, therefore, it has no repayment risk. The Company
minimizes the credit (or repayment) risk in derivative instruments by entering
into transactions with high-quality counterparties that are reviewed
periodically by the Company's credit committee. The Company also maintains a
policy of requiring that all derivative contracts be governed by an
International Swaps and Derivative Association Master Agreement; depending on
the nature of the derivative transaction, bilateral collateral arrangements may
be required as well. When the Company has more than one outstanding derivative
transaction with a counterparty, and there exists a legally enforceable master
netting agreement with the counterparty (i.e. a legal right of a setoff of
receivable and payable derivative contracts), the "net" mark-to-market exposure
represents the netting of the positive and negative exposures with the same
counterparty. When there is a net negative exposure, the Company considers its
exposure to the counterparty to be zero. The Company's policy is to use master
netting agreements with all counterparties.

    Market risk is the adverse effect that a change in interest rates, or
implied volatility rates, has on the value of a financial instrument. The
Company manages the market risk associated with interest rates by establishing
and monitoring limits as to the types and degree of risk that may be undertaken.

    The Company's Audit/Finance Committee of the Board of Directors, as part of
its oversight of the Company's asset/liability and treasury functions, monitors
the Company's derivative activities. The Company is responsible for implementing
various hedging strategies. The resulting hedging strategies are then
incorporated into the Company's overall interest rate risk management and
trading strategies.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES

    The Company enters into interest rate swaps to convert fixed rate assets
into variable rate assets and fixed rate debt into variable rate debt. The
Company's risk management policy is to match the interest rate sensitivity of
its assets and liabilities based on the Company's overall match funding
strategy.

    At March 31, 2001, the Company held fair value hedges with a net fair value
loss position of $67 million on a notional amount of $1.8 billion. For the
quarter ended March 31, 2001, the Company recognized a net loss of $9 million
(reported as "Derivative market value adjustment" in the income statement),
which represented the ineffective portion of all fair value hedges. All
components of each derivative's gain or loss are included in the assessment of
hedge effectiveness, unless otherwise noted.

                (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)

6. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)
CASH FLOW HEDGES

    The Company uses futures contracts to hedge its interest rate risk on its
assets and liabilities. The Company uses this strategy primarily to minimize its
exposure to volatility in interest rates.

    At March 31, 2001, the Company held cash flow hedges with a net fair value
loss position of $44 million on a notional amount of $27.4 billion. For the
quarter ended March 31, 2001, the Company included $39 million of after-tax
unrealized losses in other comprehensive income. Of the total other
comprehensive income, the Company recognized $1 million of after-tax net losses
related to the amortization of closed futures contracts, and $15 million of
after-tax net losses on derivatives (reported as gains and losses on sales of
securities) as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedges related to
certain forecasted transactions. The Company expects to amortize $8 million of
after-tax net losses over the next 12 months related to futures contracts closed
as of March 31, 2001. All components of each derivative's gain or loss are
included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness, unless otherwise noted.

    Gains and losses on derivative contracts that are reclassified from
accumulated other comprehensive income to current period earnings are included
in other operating income. Portions of the deferred net losses on derivative
instruments accumulated in the other comprehensive income are expected to be
reclassified as earnings during the next twelve months. This expectation is
based on the anticipated issuance of debt, at which time the Company will begin
recognizing the deferred net gains as an adjustment to interest cost. The
maximum term over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability
of future cash flows (for all forecasted transactions, excluding interest
payments on variable rate debt) is one year.

TRADING ACTIVITIES

RISK MANAGEMENT

    The Company purchases interest rate caps and futures contracts and sells
interest rate floors and futures contracts to lock in reset rates on floating
rate debt and interest rate swaps, and to partially offset the embedded floor
options in student loan assets. These relationships do not satisfy hedging
qualifications under SFAS 133, but are considered economic hedges for risk
management purposes. The Company uses this strategy to minimize its exposure to
floating rate volatility.

    The Company also uses basis swaps to "lock-in" a desired spread between the
Company's interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. These swaps
usually possess a term of one to seven years, with a pay rate indexed to
Treasury bill rates. The specific terms and notional amounts of the swaps are
determined based on management's review of its asset/liability structure, its
assessment of future interest rate relationships, as well as on other factors
such as short-term strategic initiatives.

    The Company also uses various purchased option-based products for overall
asset/liability management purposes, including options on interest rate swaps,
floor contracts, and cap contracts. These purchased products are not linked to
specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and, therefore, do not
qualify for hedge accounting treatment.

    Interest rate derivative instruments utilized by the Company in its trading
operations include interest rate and basis swaps, interest rate caps and floors,
and Eurodollar, LIBOR and Agency futures contracts.

    At March 31, 2001, the Company held trading derivatives with a net fair
value loss position of $442 million on a notional amount of $57.7 billion. For
the quarter ended March 31, 2001, the Company recognized a net loss of
$129 million (reported as "Derivative market value adjustment" in the income
statement), which represented the total change in fair value for the derivatives
designated as "trading." Also, $9 million of net derivative after-tax gains at
transition were reclassified from other comprehensive income to other operating
income. As of March 31, 2001, $32 million of transition adjustment net after-tax
gains on derivative instruments accumulated in other comprehensive income are
expected to be reclassified as earnings during the next twelve months.

OVERVIEW

    SLM HOLDING CORPORATION ("SLM HOLDING") WAS FORMED ON FEBRUARY 3, 1997 AS A
WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE STUDENT LOAN MARKETING ASSOCIATION (THE "GSE").
ON AUGUST 7, 1997, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STUDENT LOAN MARKETING ASSOCIATION
REORGANIZATION ACT OF 1996 (THE "PRIVATIZATION ACT") AND APPROVAL BY
SHAREHOLDERS OF AN AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION, THE GSE WAS REORGANIZED
INTO A SUBSIDIARY OF SLM HOLDING (THE "REORGANIZATION"). EFFECTIVE AS OF
JULY 31, 2000, SLM HOLDING CORPORATION WAS RENAMED USA EDUCATION, INC. UPON THE
COMPLETION OF THE ACQUISITION OF THE GUARANTEE SERVICING, STUDENT LOAN SERVICING
AND SECONDARY MARKET OPERATIONS OF USA GROUP, INC. ("USA GROUP"). USA
EDUCATION, INC. IS A HOLDING COMPANY THAT OPERATES THROUGH A NUMBER OF
SUBSIDIARIES INCLUDING THE GSE. REFERENCES HEREIN TO THE "COMPANY" REFER TO THE
GSE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO THE REORGANIZATION AND TO USA
EDUCATION, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES FOR PERIODS AFTER THE REORGANIZATION.

    The Company is the nation's largest private source of financing and
servicing for education loans in the United States, primarily through its
participation in the Federal Family Education Loan Program ("FFELP"), formerly
the Guaranteed Student Loan Program. The Company's products and services include
student loan purchases and commitments to purchase student loans, as well as
operational support to originators of student loans and to post-secondary
education institutions, guarantor servicing and other education-related
financial services. The Company also originates, purchases, holds and services
unguaranteed private loans.

    The following Management's Discussion and Analysis contains forward-looking
statements and information that are based on management's current expectations
as of the date of this document. Discussions that utilize the words "intend,"
"anticipate," "believe," "estimate" and "expect" and similar expressions, as
they relate to the Company's management, are intended to identify
forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject to
risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause the actual
results of the Company to be materially different from those reflected in such
forward-looking statements. Such factors include, among others, changes in the
terms of student loans and the educational credit marketplace arising from the
implementation of applicable laws and regulations and from changes in such laws
and regulations; which may reduce the volume, average term and costs of yields
on student loans under the FFELP or result in loans being originated or
refinanced under non-FFELP programs or may affect the terms upon which banks and
others agree to sell FFELP loans to the Company. The Company could also be
affected by changes in the demand for educational financing and consumer lending
or in financing preferences of lenders, educational institutions, students and
their families; and changes in the general interest rate environment and in the
securitization markets for education loans, which may increase the costs or
limit the availability of financings necessary to initiate, purchase or carry
education loans.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EARNINGS SUMMARY

    The Company's "core cash basis" net income was $145 million ($.84 diluted
earnings per share) for the three months ended March 31, 2001 versus
$109 million ($.66 diluted earnings per share) for the three months ended
March 31, 2000. "Core cash basis" results measure only the recurring earnings of
the Company. Accordingly, securitization transactions are treated as financings,
not sales, and thereby gains on such sales are eliminated. In addition, the
effect of floor revenue, certain one-time gains and losses on sales of
investment securities and student loans, certain integration charges, and the
amortization of goodwill are also excluded from net income calculated in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Similarly, in
order to preserve consistency in "core cash basis" reporting, the non-cash,
mark-to-market effects of Statement of Financial Standards No. 133
("SFAS 133"), "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,"
which became effective as of January 1, 2001, also are excluded. (See "Pro-forma
Statements of Income" for a detailed discussion of "core cash basis" net
income.)

    The increase in "core cash basis" net income in the first quarter of 2001
versus the first quarter of 2000 is mainly due to the $14.6 billion increase in
the average balance of the Company's managed portfolio of student loans,
partially offset by higher funding costs, and to the net increase in fee income
as a result of the acquisition of the operations of USA Group in July 2000.

    For the three months ended March 31, 2001, the Company's net income
calculated in accordance with GAAP was $30 million ($.16 diluted earnings per
share), versus net income of $154 million ($.93 diluted earnings per share) in
the first quarter of 2000. The decrease in GAAP net income in the first quarter
of 2001 versus the year-ago quarter is mainly due to the net impact of SFAS 133
resulting in net after-tax losses of $114 million. The after-tax, mark-to-market
losses due to the implementation of SFAS 133 include $75 million losses on Floor
Revenue Contracts (defined below under "Student Loan Floor Revenue Contracts"),
$23 million losses on interest rate swaps, $8 million losses on Eurodollar
futures contracts, and $8 million losses due to the amortization of the Floor
Revenue Contracts that were de-designated as hedges on December 31, 2000. The
decrease in GAAP net income in the first quarter 2001 versus the year-ago
quarter is also due to an increase in after-tax losses on sales of securities of
$35 million, a decrease in after-tax securitization gains of $21 million, and an
increase in after-tax operating expenses of $46 million, principally due to the
acquisition of the operations of USA Group and Student Loan Funding Resources
("SLFR") in July 2000. These decreases in net income were partially offset by an
increase in after-tax floor revenues of $23 million, an increase in after-tax
servicing and securitization revenues of $38 million, an increase in after-tax
fee income of $19 million, and an after-tax mark-to-market gain of $17 million
on Floor Revenue Contracts indexed to LIBOR that were considered trading
positions.

    During the first quarter of 2001, the Company securitized $1.5 billion of
student loans in one transaction and securitized $288 million through the
recycling provisions of the USA Group securitizations. The Company recorded
after-tax securitization gains of $6 million in the first quarter of 2001. The
Company securitized $4.0 billion of student loans in two transactions during the
first quarter of 2000 and recorded after-tax securitization gains of
$28 million.

    During the first quarter of 2001, the Company repurchased 5.5 million common
shares through its open market purchases and equity forward settlements and
issued a net 4.3 million shares as a result of benefit plans. Common shares
outstanding at March 31, 2001 totaled 163 million.

NET INTEREST INCOME

    Net interest income is derived largely from the Company's portfolio of
student loans that remain on-balance sheet. The "Taxable Equivalent Net Interest
Income" analysis set forth below is designed to facilitate a comparison of
non-taxable asset yields to taxable yields on a similar basis. Additional

                                       16
<PAGE>
information regarding the return on the Company's student loan portfolio is set
forth under "Student Loans--Student Loan Spread Analysis."

    Taxable equivalent net interest income for the three months ended March 31,
2001 versus the three months ended March 31, 2000 increased by $9 million while
the net interest margin decreased by 12 basis points. The increase in taxable
equivalent net interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2001 was
principally due to the $4.9 billion increase in the average balance of student
loans over the year-ago quarter. The decrease in the net interest margin for the
first quarter of 2001 versus the first quarter of 2000 was due to a lower return
on the investment portfolio and the impact of SFAS 133 on cost of funds,
partially offset by an increase in floor revenue.

TAXABLE EQUIVALENT NET INTEREST INCOME

    The amounts in this table and the following table are adjusted for the
impact of certain tax-exempt and tax-advantaged investments based on the
marginal federal corporate tax rate of 35 percent.

STUDENT LOANS

STUDENT LOAN SPREAD ANALYSIS

    The following table analyzes the reported earnings from student loans both
on-balance sheet and those off-balance sheet in securitization trusts. For
student loans off-balance sheet, the Company will continue to earn servicing fee
revenues over the life of the securitized student loan portfolios. The
off-balance sheet information presented in "Securitization Program--Servicing
and Securitization Revenue" analyzes the on-going servicing revenue and residual
interest earned on the securitized portfolios of student loans. For an analysis
of the Company's student loan spread for the entire portfolio of managed student
loans on a similar basis to the on-balance sheet analysis, see "'Core Cash
Basis' Student Loan Spread and Net Interest Income."

</TABLE>

    The Company's portfolio of student loans originated under the FFELP has a
variety of unique interest rate characteristics. The Company earns interest at
the greater of the borrower's rate or a floating rate determined by reference to
the average of the applicable floating rates (91-day Treasury

                                       18
<PAGE>
bill, commercial paper or 52-week Treasury bill) in a calendar quarter, plus a
fixed spread which is dependent upon when the loan was originated. If the
floating rate exceeds the borrower rate, the Department of Education makes a
payment directly to the Company based upon the special allowance payment ("SAP")
formula established under the Higher Education Act. If the floating rate is less
than the rate the borrower is obligated to pay, the Company simply earns
interest at the borrower rate. In all cases, the rate a borrower is obligated to
pay is the lowest interest rate or the floor that the Company can earn on a
student loan. The borrowers' interest rates are either fixed to term or are
reset annually on July 1 of each year depending on when the loan was originated.

    The Company generally finances its student loan portfolio with floating rate
debt tied to the average of the 91-day Treasury bill auctions, commercial paper
or 52-week Treasury bill, either directly or through the use of derivative
financial instruments intended to mimic the interest rate characteristics of the
student loans. Such borrowings generally float over all interest rate ranges. As
a result, in periods of declining interest rates, the portfolio of managed
student loans may be earning at the borrower rate while the Company's funding
costs (exclusive of fluctuations in funding spreads) generally continue to
decline along with short-term interest rates. When this happens, the difference
between the interest earned from the rate paid by the borrower and the interest
that would be earned as derived from the SAP formula is referred to as "Floor
Revenue." For loans where the borrower's interest rate is fixed to term,
declining interest rates may benefit the spread earned on student loans for
extended periods of time. For loans where the borrower's interest rate is reset
annually, any benefit of a declining interest rate environment will only enhance
student loan spreads through the next annual reset of the borrower's interest
rates, which occurs on July 1 of each year.

    Due to the decline in Treasury bill and commercial paper rates during the
first quarter of 2001, the Company realized $12 million in Floor Revenue from
student loans earning at the minimum borrower rate in the first quarter of 2001
versus $2 million of such earnings in the year-ago quarter.

    The on-balance sheet cost of funds did not decrease in tandem with the
student loan yield due to the impact from SFAS 133 treatment of Eurodollar
futures which increased first quarter 2001 cost of funds by 24 basis points as
compared to the year-ago quarter. This was partially offset by the impact of the
decline in Treasury bill and commercial paper rates on student loans earning at
the minimum borrower rate which increased the on-balance sheet student loan
spread by 11 basis points versus the year-ago quarter.

    The following table analyzes the ability of the FFELP student loans in the
Company's managed student loan portfolio to earn at the minimum borrower
interest rate at March 31, 2001 and 2000, based on the last Treasury bill
auctions of 4.31 percent and 5.88 percent, respectively, which were applicable
to those periods (dollars in billions).

STUDENT LOAN FLOOR REVENUE CONTRACTS

    Periodically, the Company has entered into contracts with third parties to
monetize the value of the minimum borrower interest rate feature of its
portfolio of FFELP student loans. Under these contracts, referred to as "Floor
Revenue Contracts," the Company receives an upfront payment and agrees to pay
the difference between (1) the minimum borrower interest rate less the
applicable SAP rate ("the strike rate") and (2) the average of the 91-day
Treasury bill rates over the period of the contract. If the strike rate is less
than the average of the Treasury bill rates, then no payment is required. Prior
to the implementation of SFAS 133, these upfront payments were amortized over
the average life of the contracts.

    Effective December 31, 2000, in anticipation of the adoption of SFAS 133,
the Floor Revenue Contracts were de-designated as effective hedges and
marked-to-market. The net effect of the fair market value of these contracts and
the unamortized upfront payments totaled $104 million and was reclassified to
student loan premium and will be amortized over the average life of the student
loan portfolio ("SFAS 133 transition adjustment"). At March 31, 2001, the
unamortized SFAS 133 transition adjustment in student loan premium totaled
$96 million. First quarter 2001 amortization totaled $4 million and the premium
write-off due to securitization totaled $4 million.

    In the first quarter of 2001, the Company recognized $115 million in
pre-tax, mark-to-market losses attributable to Floor Revenue Contracts with
$14.3 billion notional amount due to the implementation of SFAS 133. In the
first quarter of 2000, the amortization of the upfront payments received from
the sale of Floor Revenue Contracts on the Company's on-balance sheet student
loans was $6 million.

ON-BALANCE SHEET FUNDING COSTS

    The Company's borrowings are generally variable-rate indexed principally to
the 91-day Treasury bill rate. The following table summarizes the average

SECURITIZATION PROGRAM

    During the first quarter of 2001, the Company completed a securitization
transaction in which a total of $1.5 billion of student loans were sold to a
special purpose finance subsidiary and by that subsidiary to a trust that issued
asset-backed securities to fund the student loans to term. Also in the first
quarter 2001, the Company securitized $288 million through the recycling
provisions of the USA Group securitizations. During the first quarter of 2000,
the Company securitized $4.0 billion through two transactions.

GAINS ON STUDENT LOAN SECURITIZATIONS

    For the three months ended March 31, 2001, the Company recorded pre-tax
securitization gains of $9 million, which was .53 percent of the portfolio
securitized, versus $42 million gains in the first quarter of 2000 or
1.05 percent of the portfolio securitized. The decrease in the first quarter
2001 securitization gain as a percentage of the portfolio securitized versus the
year-ago quarter is mainly due to the increase in the premium balance of loans
securitized due to the SFAS 133 transition adjustment (see "Student Loan Floor
Revenue Contracts"). Gains on future securitizations will continue to vary
depending on the size and the loan characteristics of the loan portfolios
securitized and the funding costs prevailing in the securitization debt markets.

</TABLE>

    In the first quarter of 2001, servicing and securitization revenue was
1.62 percent of average securitized loans versus 1.23 percent in the year-ago
quarter. The increase in servicing and securitization revenue as a percentage of
the average balance of securitized student loans in the first quarter of 2001
versus the first quarter of 2000 is principally due to the impact of the decline
in

                                       21
<PAGE>
Treasury bill and commercial paper rates during the first quarter of 2001, which
increased the earnings from those student loans in the trusts that were earning
the minimum borrower rate in a manner similar to on-balance sheet student loans.

OTHER INCOME

    Other income, exclusive of gains on student loan securitizations, servicing
and securitization revenue, the "Derivative market value adjustment", gains on
sales of student loans, and certain one-time gains and losses on sales of
investment securities totaled $86 million for the three months ended March 31,
2001 versus $28 million for the three months ended March 31, 2000. Other income
mainly includes guarantor servicing fees, late fees earned on student loans,
revenue received from servicing third party portfolios of student loans, and
commitment fees for letters of credit. Guarantor servicing fees arise primarily
from four categories of services that correspond to the student loan life cycle.
They include fees from loan originations, the maintenance of loan guarantees,
default prevention, and collections. Included in other operating income for the
first quarter of 2001 was $74 million of income attributable to the guarantor
servicing, loan servicing and other income from the USA Group transaction which
closed in July 2000.

</TABLE>

    Operating expenses include costs to service the Company's managed student
loan portfolio, operational costs incurred in the process of acquiring student
loan portfolios, general and administrative expenses and, beginning in
August 2000, operational costs associated with its guarantor servicing
operations. Operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2001 and
2000 were $167 million and $96 million, respectively. The increase in general
and administrative expenses of $37 million and the increase in servicing and
acquisition expenses of $34 million over the year-ago quarter was mainly due to
the addition of operating expenses connected with the acquisitions of SLFR and
USA Group which closed in July 2000.

PRO-FORMA STATEMENTS OF INCOME

    Under GAAP, the Company's securitization transactions have been treated as
sales. At the time of sale, in accordance with SFAS 140, the Company records an
asset equal to the present value of the estimated future net cash flows from the
portfolio of loans sold and a gain equal to the difference between that asset
and the allocated cost basis of the loans sold. Interest earned on the interest
residual and fees earned for servicing the loan portfolios are recognized over
the life of the securitization transaction as servicing and securitization
revenue. Under SFAS 140, income recognition is effectively accelerated through
the recognition of a gain at the time of sale while the ultimate realization of
such income remains dependent on the actual performance, over time, of the loans
that were securitized.

    Effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2001, the Company adopted
SFAS 133 which requires that every derivative instrument be recorded in the
balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value (see
Notes 2 and 6 to "Consolidated Financial Statements"). Most of the derivative
contracts into which the Company enters are effective economic hedges for its
interest rate management strategy but are not effective hedges under SFAS 133.
The majority of these hedges are treated as "trading" for GAAP purposes and,
therefore, the resulting mark-to-market is taken into GAAP earnings. For
example, SFAS 133 requires that the Company mark-to-market its written options
but not its embedded options in its student loan assets. Effectively, in this
case, SFAS 133 recognizes the liability, but not the corresponding asset.

    Management believes that, in addition to results of operations as reported
in accordance with GAAP, another important performance measure is pro-forma
results of operations under the assumption that the securitization transactions
are financings and that the securitized student loans were not sold. As such, no
gain on sale or subsequent servicing and securitization revenue is recognized.
Instead, the earnings of the student loans in the trusts and the related
financing costs are reflected over the life of the underlying pool of loans. The
pro-forma results of operations also exclude the effect of floor income, certain
one-time gains and losses on sales of investment securities and student loans,
certain integration charges, the non-cash, mark-to-market effects of SFAS 133,
and the

                                       23
<PAGE>
amortization of goodwill. Management refers to these pro-forma results as "core
cash basis" statements of income. Management monitors and reports the periodic
"core cash basis" earnings of the Company's managed student loan portfolio and
believes that they assist in a better understanding of the Company's student
loan business.

    The following table presents the "core cash basis" statements of income and
reconciliations to GAAP net income as reflected in the Company's consolidated
statements of income.

</TABLE>

    The Company generally earns interest at the greater of the borrower's rate
or a floating rate determined by reference to the applicable floating rates
(91-day Treasury bill, commercial paper or 52-week Treasury bill) in a calendar
quarter, plus a fixed spread which is dependent upon when the loan was
originated. In all cases, the rate the borrower pays sets a minimum rate for
determining the yield the Company earns on the loan. The Company generally
finances its student loan portfolio with floating rate debt tied to the average
of the 91-day Treasury bill auctions, the commercial paper index or the 52-week
Treasury bill, either directly or through the use of derivative financial
instruments, to mimic the interest rate characteristics of the student loans.
Such borrowings, however, generally do not have minimum rates. As a result, in
certain declining interest rate environments, the portfolio of

                                       25
<PAGE>
managed student loans may be earning at the minimum borrower rate while the
Company's funding costs (exclusive of fluctuations in funding spreads) will
generally decline along with short term interest rates. For loans where the
borrower's interest rate is fixed to term, lower interest rates may benefit the
spread earned on student loans for extended periods of time. For loans where the
borrower's interest rate is reset annually, any benefit of a low interest rate
environment will only enhance student loan spreads through the next annual reset
of the borrower's interest rate, which occurs on July 1 of each year. Due to the
decline in Treasury bill and commercial paper rates in the first quarter of
2001, the Company realized $38 million in Floor Revenue from student loans
earning at the minimum borrower rate in the first quarter of 2001 versus
$2 million of such earnings in the year-ago quarter. These earnings have been
excluded from student loan income to calculate the "core cash basis" student
loan spread.

    While Floor Revenue is excluded from "core cash basis" results, the
amortization of the upfront payments received from the Floor Revenue Contracts
is included as an addition to student loan income in the "core cash basis"
results. For the three months ended March 31, 2001 and 2000, the amortization of
the upfront payments received from the Floor Revenue Contracts with fixed
borrower rates was $8 million and $5 million, respectively, and for Floor
Revenue Contracts with annually reset borrower rates was $5 million and
$1 million, respectively. In addition, during the three months ended March 31,
2001, a loss of $12 million of unamortized upfront payments was recognized in
premium income due to the extinguishment of $1.2 billion of Floor Revenue
Contracts on annual reset loans. At March 31, 2001, unamortized payments
received from the sale of Floor Revenue Contracts totaled $133 million,
$114 million of which related to contracts on fixed rate loans and $19 million
of which related to contracts on annual reset loans. The $13.2 billion of
outstanding fixed borrower rate Floor Revenue Contracts at March 31, 2001 have
expiration dates through the year 2008, while the $1.1 billion of annually reset
borrower rate contracts outstanding at March 31, 2001 have expiration dates
through the year 2003.

    The decrease in the first quarter of 2001 "core cash basis" student loan
spread versus the year-ago quarter is primarily attributable to the increase in
the average balance of consolidation loans as a percentage of total managed
loans which decreased the "core cash basis" student loan spread by 2 basis
points.

    The "core cash basis" net interest margin for the first quarters of 2001 and
2000 was 1.52 percent and 1.60 percent, respectively. The decrease in the first
quarter of 2001 "core cash basis" net interest margin versus the first quarter
of 2000 is mainly due to the decrease in the student loan spread discussed
above, the increased percentage of long-term debt as a percentage of total
liabilities, and an increase in short-term investments which earn income at a
lower spread.

FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES

    The Company is subject to federal and state taxes, however, the GSE is
exempt from all state, local, and District of Columbia income, franchise, sales
and use, personal property and other taxes, except for real property taxes. This
tax exemption applies only to the GSE and does not apply to USA Education, Inc.
or its other operating subsidiaries that are subject to taxation at the state
and local level. As business activity increasingly occurs outside of the GSE,
the impact of state and local taxes will increase accordingly. This was the
primary reason for the Company's effective tax rate to increase from the
statutory rate of 35 percent to 39 percent for the first quarter of 2001.

    The Company maintains a portfolio of tax-advantaged assets principally to
support education-related financing activities. That portfolio was primarily
responsible for the decrease in the effective federal income tax rate from the
statutory rate of 35 percent to 33 percent in the first quarter of 2000. State
taxes were immaterial in the three months ended March 31, 2000 as the majority
of the Company's business activities were conducted in the GSE.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

    The Company's primary requirements for capital are to fund the Company's
operations, to purchase student loans and to repay its debt obligations while
continuing to meet the GSE's statutory capital adequacy ratio test. The
Company's primary sources of liquidity are through debt issuances by its GSE
subsidiary, off-balance sheet financings through securitizations, borrowings
under its commercial paper and senior notes programs, and cash generated by its
subsidiaries' operations and distributed through dividends to the Company.

    The Company's unsecured financing requirements are driven by three principal
factors: refinancing of existing liabilities as they mature; financing of
student loan portfolio growth; and the Company's level of securitization
activity.

    In the first quarter of 2001, the Company completed one securitization
transaction totaling $1.5 billion in student loans and an additional
$300 million through the recycling provisions of the securitizations acquired
from USA Group. The Company manages the resulting off-balance sheet basis risk
with on-balance sheet financing and derivative instruments, which principally
consists of basis swaps and Eurodollar futures.

    During the first quarter of 2001, the Company used the net proceeds from
student loan securitizations of $1.8 billion, net proceeds from the issuance of
debt of $2.0 billion, and repayments and claim payments on student loans of
$922 million to purchase student loans of $3.6 billion, to increase investments
by $497 million, and to repurchase $323 million of the Company's common stock.

    Operating activities used net cash of $94 million in the first quarter of
2001, a decrease of $252 million from the net cash inflows of $158 million in
the year-ago quarter.

    During the first quarter of 2001, the Company issued $2.2 billion of
long-term notes to refund maturing and repurchased obligations. At March 31,
2001, the Company had $9.8 billion of outstanding long-term debt issues of which
$486 million had stated maturities that could be accelerated through call
provisions. The Company uses interest rate and foreign currency swaps
(collateralized where appropriate), purchases of U.S. Treasury securities, and
other hedging techniques to reduce its exposure to interest rate and currency
fluctuations that arise from its financing activities and to match the variable
interest rate characteristics of its earning assets. (See "Interest Rate Risk
Management.")

    On January 1, 2000, the GSE's statutory capital adequacy ratio was increased
from 2.00 percent to 2.25 percent. At March 31, 2001, the GSE's statutory
capital adequacy ratio, after the effect of the dividends to be paid in the
second quarter of 2001, was 2.32 percent.

INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT

INTEREST RATE GAP ANALYSIS

    The Company's principal objective in financing its operations is to minimize
its sensitivity to changing interest rates by matching the interest rate
characteristics of its borrowings to specific assets in order to lock in
spreads. The Company funds its floating rate managed loan assets (most of which
have weekly rate resets) with variable rate debt and fixed rate debt converted
to variable rates with interest rate swaps. The Company also uses interest rate
cap agreements, foreign currency swaps, options on securities, and financial
futures contracts to further reduce interest rate risk and foreign currency
exposure on certain of its borrowings. Investments are funded on a "pooled"
approach, i.e., the pool of liabilities that funds the investment portfolio has
an average rate and maturity or reset date that corresponds to the average rate
and maturity or reset date of the investments which they fund.

    In addition to term match funding, $14.7 billion of the Company's
asset-backed securities match the interest rate characteristics of the majority
of the student loans in the trusts by being indexed to the 91-day Treasury bill.
At March 31, 2001, there were approximately $3.4 billion of PLUS student loans

                                       27
<PAGE>
outstanding in the trusts, which have interest rates that reset annually based
on the final auction of 52-week Treasury bills before each July 1. In addition,
at March 31, 2001, approximately $16.3 billion of asset-backed securities had
been indexed to LIBOR. In its securitization transactions, the Company retains
this basis risk and manages it through its on-balance sheet financing
activities. The effect of this basis risk management is included in the
following table as the impact of securitized student loans.

    In the table below the Company's variable rate assets and liabilities are
categorized by reset date of the underlying index. Fixed rate assets and
liabilities are categorized based on their maturity dates. The notional amount
of interest rate swap contracts is included in the "Off-balance Sheet Financial
Instruments" section of the table below. An interest rate gap is the difference
between volumes of assets and volumes of liabilities maturing or repricing
during specific future time intervals. The following gap analysis reflects
rate-sensitive positions at March 31, 2001 and is not necessarily reflective of
positions that existed throughout the period.

INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

    The effect of short-term movements in interest rates on the Company's
results of operations and financial position has been limited through the
Company's risk management activities. The Company performed a sensitivity
analysis to determine the effect of a hypothetical increase in market interest
rates of 10 percent on the Company's variable rate assets and liabilities and a
hypothetical 10 percent increase in spreads to their underlying index. Based on
this analysis, there has not been a material change in market risk from
December 31, 2000 as reported in the Company's Form 10-K.

    In the above table, Treasury receipts and variable rate asset-backed
securities, although generally liquid in nature, extend the weighted average
remaining term to maturity of cash and investments to 4.2 years. As student
loans are securitized, the need for long-term on-balance sheet financing will
decrease.

COMMON STOCK

    The Company repurchased 5.5 million shares during the first quarter of 2001
through open market purchases and equity forward settlements and issued a net
4.3 million shares as a result of benefit plans. At March 31, 2001, the total
common shares that could potentially be acquired over the next four years under
outstanding equity forward contracts was 16.5 million, and the Company had a
remaining authority to enter into additional share repurchases and equity
forward contracts for 10.9 million shares.
